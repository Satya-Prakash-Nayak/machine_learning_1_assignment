    "### Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. Here are some key aspects and examples are AI-powered assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant help with tasks such as setting reminders, answering questions, and controlling smart home devices1.\n",

Examples include:Image Recognition: Used in healthcare for diagnosing diseases from medical images, and in autonomous vehicles for obstacle detection1.\n",

The goal is for the model to learn the relationship between the input data and the output labels so it can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. ex:- linear regression, decision trees,suport vector machine"
